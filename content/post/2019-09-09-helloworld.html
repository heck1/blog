<p>Yay! I managed to deploy my first Data Science related blog. I will regularly update this blog with new R-based analysis, visualizations and my thoughts on stuff. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>This blog is powered by RMarkdown, hosted on GitHub and currently runs on the amazing <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lithium-theme/">Lithium Theme for Hugo</a>. I followed <a href="https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/">this</a> very thorough tutorial and it was definitively worth it!</p>
