Yay! I managed to deploy my first Data Science related blog. I will regularly update this blog with new R-based analysis, visualizations and my thoughts on stuff. Stay tuned!

This blog is powered by RMarkdown, hosted on GitHub and currently runs on the amazing [Lithium Theme for Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lithium-theme/). I followed [this](https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/) very thorough tutorial and it was definitively worth it!
