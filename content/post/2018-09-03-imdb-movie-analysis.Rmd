When it comes to hobbies, films and listening to podcasts / youtube videos of people talking about films is one of my favorites. For a while now, I was interested in approaching this hobby in a 
data-driven manner. I stumbled upon[this old rStudio blog post])https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/) by none other than Hadley Wickham himself. 

After reading it, I wanted to try web-scraping with selectorgadget myself and imdb seemed 
like a great place to start. I followed these questions:
-- how to extract data efficiently from imdb directly?
-- how can this information be used in a informative manner?
-- how can the selectorgadget-html output be easily understood?

After some time struggeling with exploring the selectorgadget-output, but [yet another blogpost](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/266430_f3fd4660b2744751ab144aa130768a06.html) was very helpful in helping to manage the basics. After a few attempts and some cleanup, I ended with:


```{  message=FALSE }

library(rvest)
library(ROAuth)
library(tidyverse)


url <- 'https://www.imdb.com/search/title?count=100&release_date=1977,1977&title_type=feature&sort=moviemeter,asc'

# read html

imdb <- read_html(url)

genre_data_html <- html_nodes(imdb,'.genre')
title_data_html <- html_nodes(imdb,'.lister-item-header a')
title_data <- html_text(title_data_html)
genre_data <- html_text(genre_data_html)
                
title_data<-gsub("\n","",title_data)
title_data<-gsub(" ","",title_data)
                
genre_data<-gsub("\n","",genre_data)
genre_data<-gsub(" ","",genre_data)
genre_data<-gsub(",.*","",genre_data)
                
                
                
                
genre_data<-as.character(genre_data)
title_data<-as.character(title_data)

```

```
 head(genre_data)
[1] "Action"    "Drama"     "Action"    "Comedy"    "Drama"     "Animation"
```

```
head(title_data)
[1] "KriegderSterne"                    "UnheimlicheBegegnungderdrittenArt"
[3] "EinausgekochtesSchlitzohr"         "DerUntermieter"                   
[5] "NurSamstagNacht"                   "BernardundBianca-DieMÃ¤usepolizei" 
```

So we can determine that in 1977, the year the first Star Wars movie came out, it was actually the most popular movie, followed by [Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075860/?ref_=adv_li_tt).
My first instinct was, okay, now I can create a chart for the popularity of a genre in a given year.
But how can this be utilized further? Here is what I came up with:


```
yearly_fin <- data.frame()
for (y in (1960:2018)){
  url <- paste0("https://www.imdb.com/search/title?count=100&release_date=",y,",",y,"&title_type=feature&sort=boxoffice_gross_us,asc")
                imdb <- read_html(url)
                genre_data_html <- html_nodes(imdb,'.genre')
                title_data_html <- html_nodes(imdb,'.lister-item-header a')
                title_data <- html_text(title_data_html)
                genre_data <- html_text(genre_data_html)
                
                title_data<-gsub("\n","",title_data)
                title_data<-gsub(" ","",title_data)
                
                genre_data<-gsub("\n","",genre_data)
                genre_data<-gsub(" ","",genre_data)
                genre_data<-gsub(",.*","",genre_data)
                
                
                
                
                genre_data<-as.character(genre_data)
                title_data<-as.character(title_data)
if(length(genre_data) < 100){
  diff <- 100-length(genre_data)
  for (i in 1:diff)
    genre_data <- c(genre_data, as.character(i))
}
                
                yearly_data <- data.frame(title_data, genre_data)
                yearly_data$year <- y
                yearly_fin <- rbind(yearly_fin, yearly_data)
  print(y)
}
```

By just looping over the years in the underlying url, one can scrape the complete time-frame on a yearly basis in around 3 minutes (depending on your internet connection). Then, I used the output of
```yearly_fin``` to create this plot:

width=85% }
As we can see, for example _Horror_ was really popular in the 80s,hen vanished in the beginning of the 90s and came back in the early 2000s.

Further information about the scraping process can be found in the complete code [here](https://gist.github.com/heck1/6e69e87bf277fb12789ddfe202ba8670). 
What is next? Well, apart from this analysis barely scratching the surface of what is actually possible with rvest and the imdb-data in current form, I also was able to find the short description imdb uses in their rankings (```html_nodes(imdb,'.lister-item-header a'``` ), which should provide useful for an text-based prediction on a film`s popularity or (expexted?) gross.
