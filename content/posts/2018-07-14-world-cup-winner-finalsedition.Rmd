As it turns out, France is the clear favorite to win the World Cup tomorrow. On average, the probability of France winning is around 70% and for Croatia, the underdog, the probability based on the odds is around 30%. 

If you want to know more, see my [original blog post](https://heck1.github.io/blog/2018/07/09/world-cup-winner-semifinals-edition/).

Good luck to both teams tomorrow :)
