The datasets we are going to use are races, which includes data about the specific races, like name of the circuit, year of the GP. laps provides lap times for each GP, each driver and each round in that GP.</description>

      <description>When it comes to hobbies, films and listening to podcasts / youtube videos of people talking about films is one of my favorites.

      <description>Since Croatia beat Russia on Saturday, the Semifinals for this yearâ€™s World Cup are set:
 England Belgium France Croatia  I wanted to see wether the variance in odds between bookmarkers allows to draw conclusions on who will actually win (of course, it most likely will not). Without further ado, here is the final plot:
